## Conversation Summary

user: [Sat 2026-02-28 10:12 PST] I want to create a content bot that will search for any Information around Gamestop (GME) and Ryan Cohen (CEO) using Brave and Twitter. Once content is pulled I want to summarize it, post it to new Discord channel #gamestop-news. Once posted I can ask for it to change and eventually I will approve or reject it. If I approve it I want it to be reposted to my Twitter account.

assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Here’s how I’d tackle that bot:

**1. Data sources**
- Brave: use their Web Search API with saved queries for “Gamestop”, “GME”, “Ryan Cohen”. Pull article URL, title, snippet, publish time. Add simple dedupe by canonical URL so we don’t spam repeats.  
- Twitter/X: tap their v2 search endpoint (or something like Bluesky/Pushshift if you want a cheaper firehose) filtered on $GME, $GME squeeze, @ryancohen, etc. You’ll need Elevated access to stay within rate limits.

**2. Normalization + storage**
- Drop everything into a small Postgres table (`sources`, `raw_text`, `author`, `timestamp`, `type`).  
- Run a quick classifier to discard price-only tweets or meme spam; lightweight keyword heuristics might be enough to start.

**3. Summaries**
- Use a budget model (Gemini Flash) with a prompt that produces: headline, 2–3 sentence summary, “why it matters”, and link attribution. Keep token cost down by trimming to 500–700 characters before summarizing.  
- Save both the summary and its status (`draft`, `needs_changes`, `approved`, `rejected`).

**4. Discord workflow**
- Spin up a new channel `#gamestop-news`.  
- Bot posts each draft with buttons or slash commands:
  - `/approve <id>`
  - `/revise <id> "new summary"`
  - `/reject <id> [reason]`

When you hit approve, flip the status and queue it for Twitter. If you request changes, overwrite the summary (either manually or by re-running the model with your notes). Rejected entries stay archived so we don’t re-ingest the same junk.

**5. Twitter publishing**
- Once approved, template the post: headline + tight summary + link + optional hashtag (#GME, #RyanCohen).  
- Use your Twitter client (v2 POST `tweets`) with rate limiting + exponential backoff. Record the tweet ID so we don’t double post.

**6. Scheduling + monitoring**
- Cron job or worker every 10 minutes: run Brave/Twitter fetch, summarize new items, push to Discord.  
- Another worker watches for `approved` entries and publishes them to Twitter.  
- Add logging + alerting (even a Discord DM) if either API starts erroring or we approach rate limits.

**What I still need from you**
1. API credentials for Brave, Twitter, Discord bot (and confirmation we’re clear to store them in 1Password or env vars).  
2. Hosting preference: run this on your Mac, or deploy to a cheap VPS/container?  
3. Any compliance constraints? (e.g., no auto-linking to certain sources, trading restrictions).  
4. Tone rules for the summaries/tweets—do you want them dry and factual, or with commentary?

Once I have that, I’ll farm out the coding pieces to the right sub-agents: one handles ingestion + storage, another wires Discord/Twitter, and a third writes the summarizer prompts plus approval flow. Let me know the answers above and I’ll queue up the builds.
