[Sun 2026-02-22 14:15 PST] check gemini integration again
assistant: **Checking local skills**[Historical context: a different model called tool "exec" with arguments: {
  "command": "ls -F skills/"
}. Do not mimic this format - use proper function calling.]

[Sun 2026-02-22 14:18 PST] check what is wrong with my gemini model integration
assistant: **Checking skills and environment for Gemini configuration**
assistant: **Diagnosing missing Gemini setup**
assistant: **Checking Gemini CLI availability**
assistant: **Testing Gemini CLI functionality**
assistant: **Reporting missing Gemini credentials**[[reply_to_current]]The `gemini` CLI is installed, but it’s failing because no API key is configured.

**Error:**
> Please set an Auth method in your /Users/djloky/.gemini/settings.json or specify one of the following environment variables before running: GEMINI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI, GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_GCA

**Fix:**
Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), paste it here, and I’ll add it to your `.env` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Once that’s set, the integration should work.

assistant: **Confirming Gemini setup**[[reply_to_current]]Gemini integration is active. The key is now stored in `~/.openclaw/.env` and the CLI responds correctly.

```bash
$ gemini "Hello"
Hello. How can I assist you with your project today?
```

You can now use `gemini "query"` directly or in scripts.

[Sun 2026-02-22 14:50 PST] I want you to use Gemini-flash for all the routing and default requests. If you need to code something either internal or by request I want you to delegate that to coding agent. Never do it yourself. In case that you cannot solve problem or need additional help I want you to use Gemini-PRO model.
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Got it—default to Gemini-flash for normal routing, escalate to Gemini-PRO when I’m stuck or need extra horsepower, and hand anything coding-related off to the coding agent every time. I’ll follow that workflow from here on out.
